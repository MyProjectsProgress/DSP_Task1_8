# Sampling Studio

## Description

A web application that illustrates the signal sampling and it's recovery showing the importance and validation of the Nyquist rate.

## Features

- Sample & Recover: Allow the user to load a mid-length signal (Limit 200MB per file • CSV), visualize and sample it via different frequencies, then use the sampled points to recover the original signal using Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.

- Load & Compose: The loaded signal can come a file or a signal mixer/composer. In the signal mixer, the user can add multiple sinusoidal signals of different frequencies and magnitudes. The user can also remove any of the components during preparing the mixed signal.

- Additive noise: The user can add noise to the loaded signal with custom/controllable SNR level. The program is able to show the dependency of the noise effect on the signal frequency.

- Real-time: Sampling and recovery is done in real time upon user changes.

- Resize: The application can be resized easily without messing up your UI.
